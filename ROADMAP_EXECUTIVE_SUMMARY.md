❌ **Don't:** Over-engineer early  
✅ **Do:** Start simple, scale based on usage

❌ **Don't:** Ignore your users  
✅ **Do:** Get feedback constantly

## 📞 Need Help?

**For each feature in ROADMAP.md, you'll find:**
- Detailed implementation guide
- Code examples
- File structure
- Testing approach
- Success metrics

**Estimated effort is based on:**
- Solo developer
- Part-time work (10-15 hrs/week)
- Includes testing and documentation

**To accelerate:**
- Pair program with a friend
- Use AI coding assistants
- Hire a contractor for specific features
- Reduce scope (MVP first, iterate later)

---

## 🎉 Final Thought

Your app is already good. These improvements will make it *great*.

Start small, ship fast, measure everything, iterate constantly.

**Don't try to do everything at once.** Pick ONE feature from the 90-day plan and nail it. Then move to the next.

The goal isn't to build the perfect app. The goal is to build an app your users love a little more each week.

You've got this! 🚀🏒
