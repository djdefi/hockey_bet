## Running Tests Locally

To ensure the HTML generation and ERB templates are functioning correctly, you can run tests locally before submitting a pull request. Follow these steps:

1. Install Ruby using the version specified in the `.ruby-version` file.
2. Install dependencies by running `bundle install`.
3. Execute the script with `ruby script-new.rb` to generate the HTML files.

This process will help identify any issues with the HTML generation or ERB templates before they are integrated into the main branch.
