## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.4+ with Bundler (automatically provided in GitHub Codespaces)
- Basic knowledge of CSV for team mapping

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. If using GitHub Codespaces, everything is pre-configured for you
3. If running locally, install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```

### Running the Application

The project includes standardized scripts in the `bin/` directory:

1. **Setup the environment**:
   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```

2. **Update NHL data**:
   ```bash
   bin/update
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   bin/test
   ```

4. **Start the local server**:
   ```bash
   bin/server
   ```
   Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

### Customization

1. Edit `fan_team.csv` to map your fantasy league members to NHL teams:
   ```
   fan,team
   Alice,Bruins
   Bob,Maple Leafs
   ```

4. Run the update script:
   ```
   ruby update_standings.rb
   ```

5. Open `_site/index.html` in your browser to view the standings

### Deployment

The simplest way to deploy is using GitHub Pages:

1. Push your changes to GitHub
2. Enable GitHub Pages on your repository
3. Set the build directory to `_site`

## Configuration

### Fan Team Mapping

The `fan_team.csv` file maps fan names to teams. The format is simple:
```
fan,team
Alice,Bruins
Bob,Maple Leafs
```

The "team" column can use full names, city names, or common nicknames - the system will attempt to match them to the correct NHL team.
