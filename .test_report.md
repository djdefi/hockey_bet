# NHL Standings Refactoring Test Report

## Summary
This report documents the changes made to the NHL standings table to improve logic clarity, visual consistency, accessibility, and testability as per the enhancement requirements.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Playoff Status Logic
‚úÖ Simplified the 4-tier system to 3 clearly defined statuses:
- **Clinched** (‚úîÔ∏è): Teams with `divisionSequence <= 3`
- **Contending** (‚ö†Ô∏è): Teams with `wildcardSequence <= 2`
- **Eliminated** (‚ùå): Teams with `wildcardSequence > 2`

### 2. Timezone Display
‚úÖ Improved UTC to Pacific time conversion with automatic DST handling
‚úÖ Formatted game times in a consistent, readable format (e.g., "4/10 16:30")
‚úÖ Added "Pacific Time" label to timestamps for clarity

### 3. UI & Accessibility Enhancements
‚úÖ Added `aria-label` attributes to all status icons for screen readers
‚úÖ Added semantic HTML elements with proper roles
‚úÖ Improved mobile responsiveness with better CSS media queries
‚úÖ Added a clear visual legend explaining the status indicators
‚úÖ Made fan-owned teams stand out visually
‚úÖ Fixed the flame emoji (üî•) logic to only show for games between two fan-owned teams

### 4. Testing
‚úÖ Created comprehensive test fixtures:
  - `teams.json`: Sample NHL team data with various standings positions
  - `schedule.json`: Sample upcoming games data
  - `fan_team.csv`: Sample fan-to-team mappings

‚úÖ Implemented RSpec tests for:
  - Playoff status determination logic
  - Timezone conversion accuracy
  - Table row coloring logic
  - Rendering of tooltips, icons, and status labels
  - Fan team opponent detection
  - API validation and resilience

### 5. Code Organization & Production Readiness
‚úÖ Reorganized code into a proper object-oriented structure
‚úÖ Created an ApiValidator class to handle API schema changes
‚úÖ Added GitHub Actions workflow for PR preview deployments
‚úÖ Added API change detection with automated notifications
‚úÖ Improved error handling throughout the codebase
‚úÖ Created a clean main entry point script (update_standings.rb)

## Testing Results
All tests are passing, confirming that the refactored code meets the requirements:

‚úÖ Playoff Status Logic: Correctly categorizes teams into clinched, contending, or eliminated
‚úÖ Timezone Conversion: Correctly converts UTC times to Pacific with DST handling
‚úÖ HTML Structure: Proper semantic structure with accessible elements
‚úÖ Fan Team Logic: Flame emoji only appears for games between two fan-owned teams
‚úÖ API Validation: Properly validates API responses and handles errors gracefully

## Conclusion
The refactored NHL standings table now has:
- Clearer, more consistent status indicators
- Improved accessibility for screen readers
- Better responsive design for mobile devices
- Accurate Pacific timezone display with DST handling
- Comprehensive test coverage to prevent regressions
- Early detection of NHL API schema changes
- Preview deployments for pull requests

This implementation meets all the specified acceptance criteria and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements.
